By day, I wrangle spreadsheets in the mortal coil of [your job/industry]; by night, I commune with R’s arcane arts—summoning simulations, divining distributions, and occasionally cursing at convergence warnings.\nThis digital sanctum? Born from a late-night epiphany: Statistics isn’t just numbers; it’s prophecy. From humble rnorm() incantations to full-blown Bayesian soothsaying, every post here charts my ascent. Inspired by prophets past (Tukey, Fisher) and code gurus (Hadley Wickham, foremost), I share the scrolls: raw code, reproducible rituals, and hard-won revelations.\nWhy share? To light torches for fellow seekers—whether you’re debugging your first GLM or forecasting apocalypses with ARIMA. No gatekeeping; just open-source enlightenment."
