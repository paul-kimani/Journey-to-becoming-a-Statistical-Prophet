## Who Wanders This Path?

I am Paul, a code-tinkering mortal on the quest to unravel data's divine riddles. By day, I wrangle spreadsheets in the mortal coil of [your job/industry]; by night, I commune with R's arcane arts—summoning simulations, divining distributions, and occasionally cursing at convergence warnings.

This digital sanctum? Born from a late-night epiphany: Statistics isn't just numbers; it's prophecy. From humble `rnorm()` incantations to full-blown Bayesian soothsaying, every post here charts my ascent. Inspired by prophets past (Tukey, Fisher) and code gurus (Hadley Wickham, foremost), I share the scrolls: raw code, reproducible rituals, and hard-won revelations.

Why share? To light torches for fellow seekers—whether you're debugging your first GLM or forecasting apocalypses with ARIMA. No gatekeeping; just open-source enlightenment.

```{r stats-wisdom}
# A humble oracle's table of timeless stats truths
wisdom <- data.frame(
  Prophet = c("George Box", "Francis Galton", "Carl Gauss"),
  Revelation = c(
    "All models are wrong, but some are useful.",
    "The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.",
    "Error is the discipline through which we advance."
  ),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

knitr::kable(wisdom, 
             col.names = c("Sage", "Eternal Truth"),
             caption = "Whispers from the Stats Ancients")
