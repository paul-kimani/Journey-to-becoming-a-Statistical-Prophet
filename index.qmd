## Greetings, Seeker of Patterns

In the vast chaos of data, lies the power to foresee. This site chronicles my odyssey from novice code-wrangler to oracle of oddsâ€”armed with R, simulations, and a healthy dose of humility. 

Expect:
- **Simulations**: Monte Carlo rituals to summon distributions from the void.
- **Prophecies**: Bayesian divinations and time-series auguries.
- **Reflections**: Lessons etched in code and charts.

Start with a humble oracle: Behold, 10,000 whispers from the normal distribution, revealing the bell's eternal curve.

```{r normal-prophecy}
# Seed for reproducible revelations
set.seed(42)

# Summon the normals
n_draws <- 10000
normals <- rnorm(n_draws, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# Divine the histogram
hist(normals, 
     main = "The Bell's Eternal Whisper: 10,000 Normal Revelations", 
     xlab = "Realm of Values", 
     ylab = "Echoes of Frequency", 
     col = "steelblue", 
     breaks = 50,
     border = "white")
