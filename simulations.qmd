## Uniform Distribution

Behold 5000 uniforms—adjust "n" in code for your rituals (static snapshot here).

```{r uniform-sim, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
n_draws <- 5000  # Fixed "slider" value—tweak and re-render!
set.seed(123)
uniforms <- runif(n_draws, min = 0, max = 1)
df <- data.frame(x = uniforms)

ggplot(df, aes(x)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.7) + 
  labs(title = paste("Uniform Whispers:", n_draws, "Draws"), x = "Value", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```
